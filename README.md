Where I've Been Inclusive - I am creating this app to be a simple way to keep track of the countries that you've been to. It differs from similar apps in two key ways: 

1. You can include whatever countries you'd like. For example, Taiwan and Palestine are not recognized by the UN but you can count them as countries you've been to. Perhaps you visited Hong Kong before 1997 or even recently and would like to count it as a separate country - no problem. 
2. This app is very simple by design and has one purpose: To keep track of the number of countries you've been to.
